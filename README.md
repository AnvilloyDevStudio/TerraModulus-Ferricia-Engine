## Open Dynamics Engine (ODE)

Note that there exists a binding library of ODE, [`ode-base`](https://crates.io/crates/ode-base),
but it is not actively maintained, which is not ideal for continuous development of this
project. Instead, a custom binding crate has been made in [`ode`](/ode), which is not published.
